# Enigma
A message encrypting website using algorithms of **Morse Code** and **Caesar Cipher**. User can encrypt their message in any two of these languages.

## Algorithm
Two separate algorithm are used, one for Morse Code and other for Caesar Cipher.

For **Caesar Cipher** constraint of **fixed** 5 increment is used to encrypt the message.

For **Morse Code** an array of encrypted alphabets and number is used to replace with characters of message inputed.

## Styling
To display brief of each encrypting algorithm, I have design a box which appears in desktop view to 760px (tablet view) least screen size. For mobile view, I have designed an overlay side-menu to diplay the brief.
